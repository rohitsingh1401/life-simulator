Basic Usage
===========
Run life.py through cmd and code in the matrices to get the simulation started.


Credits
===========
Credit for the vast majority of code here goes to [yamadapc](https://github.com/yamadapc)! I've merely created a wrapper around all of the important functions to get people started.
